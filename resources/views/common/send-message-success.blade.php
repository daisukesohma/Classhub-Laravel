                        <li>Your tutor has received your message and will write back to you shortly. (Usually within
                            24 hours). We suggest messaging two other tutors in case this one can't help.
                        </li>
                        <li>Message back and forth to ask any questions and agree the time and location of your
                            lesson. Keep the messages on the site as we’ll step in if you need any help.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once you are both happy, the tutor will create a booking and send it to your classhub
                            inbox.
                        </li>
                        <li>You'll be asked to confirm the lesson by entering your payment details. Please note;
                            Classhub tutors do not accept cash and Classhub will only release payment to the tutor
                            24 hours after each session you have.
                        </li>
                        <li>For online tuition you will be sent a booking to accept, once you click accept and make payment we’ll update your bookings area with your new online tuition booking.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy your lessons and reaching your learning goals together!</li>
