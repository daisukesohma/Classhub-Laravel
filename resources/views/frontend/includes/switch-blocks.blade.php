        <p>
          Online tutoring allows you to access the most suitable tutor for you regardless of location, and to learn from the comfort of your own home.
          Once you and your tutor have agreed on a date and time, your tutor will make a booking and schedule a lesson for you.  You’ll be asked to confirm and pay for the booking in advance of the lesson.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          You can have confidence with your new tutor and focus on reaching your goals together. If you or the tutor need to cancel or move your lesson, that's ok, we keep all payments until after each lesson takes place so in the case of a cancelation, everything is 100% refunded.
