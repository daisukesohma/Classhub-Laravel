                                <li>We have a legitimate interest to send you electronic communications/direct marketing in connection with the Service and related matters (which may include but shall not be limited to newsletters, announcement of new features etc. and which may also appear on social media such as Facebook etc.). We may also ask you for your consent to send you direct marketing from time to time. We may also ask you different questions for different services, including competitions, and ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
                                <li>We may send direct marketing relevant to our Service to Providers, based on our legitimate interest to do so, and Providers will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such direct marketing at the time of registration of their Account. Providers will be asked for their date of birth when registering for their Accounts – direct marketing will not be sent to any Provider or User under 18 years of age.</li>
                                <li>You can ask us to stop contacting you for direct marketing purposes. If you would like to do this, please:
                                  <ol>

It may take up to 15 days for this to take place, or adjust your settings on the Website to elect to not receive direct marketing messages in future; and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      let us know what method of contact you are not happy with if you are unhappy with certain ways of contacting you only (for example, you may be happy for us to contact you by email but not by telephone).

Unsubscribing from direct marketing does not unsubscribe you from essential electronic communications in respect of the administration of Your Account.

                              You may ask us to ensure that, if we are evaluating you, we don’t base any decisions solely on an automated process and have any decision reviewed by a member of staff. Profiling may occur in relation to your Personal Data for the purposes of targeted advertising and de-targeting you from specified advertising. This allows us to tailor our advertising to the appropriate customers and helps to minimise the risk of you receiving unwanted advertising. These rights will not apply in all circumstances, for example where the decision is (i) authorised or required by law, (ii) necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us, or (ii) is based on your explicit consent. In all cases, we will endeavour that steps have been taken to safeguard your interests.

                      This Privacy Policy applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by Classhub. We do not exercise control over the sites/applications that may be linked from our Website. These other sites/applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.

                      <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></span>
                      <ol>
                        <li>We do our utmost to protect user privacy through the appropriate use of security technology. We restrict access to Your Data to employees, contractors and agents who need to know Your Data in order to operate, develop or improve the services that we provide. We ensure that we have appropriate physical and technological security measures to protect your information; and we ensure that when we outsource any processes that the service provider has appropriate security measures in place. However, our Website may contain hyperlinks to Websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.</li>
                        <li>We will implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Your Data. In particular, we will consider the risks presented by accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Your Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</li>
                        <li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect Your Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted us and any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other loss or damage resulting from (i) the transfer of data over communications networks and facilities, including the internet, or (ii) any delay or delivery failure on the part of any other service provider not contracted by us, and you acknowledge that our Website may be subject to limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities. You will appreciate that we cannot guarantee the absolute prevention of cyber-attacks such as hacking, spyware and viruses. Accordingly, you will not hold us liable for any unauthorized disclosure, loss or destruction of Your Data arising from such risks.

                      <ol>
                        <li>We will notify serious data breaches in respect of Your Data to the DPC without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of same. If notification is not made after 72 hours, we will record a reasoned justification for the delay; however, it is not necessary to notify the DPC where the Personal Data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. A Personal Data breach in this context means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</li>
                        <li>We will keep a record of any data breaches, including their effects and the remedial action taken, and will notify you of any data breach affecting your Personal Data (which poses a high risk to you) when we are required to do so under Data Protection Legislation. We will not be required to notify you of a data breach where:
                          <ol>
                            <li>we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures that render the Personal Data unintelligible to anyone not authorised to access it, such as encryption; or</li>
                            <li>we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to data subjects is not likely to materialise; or</li>
                            <li>it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case we may make a public communication instead.</li>

                        <li>Your Data will be kept and stored for such period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the purpose for which it was collected in the first instance. This may include retaining Your Data as necessary to administer Your Account, comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements (including for the 6 year limitation period in Ireland for contractual claims, plus a reasonable period thereafter), to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Service.</li>
                        <li>Where we retain information for Service/website improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Service/Website, not to specifically analyse personal characteristics about you.</li>

We may also remove any such material from any of our social media pages.</li>
                        <li>Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws, for example on hate speech, we may disclose your personal information to relevant third parties, including to law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. We would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including Data Protection Legislation.</li>
