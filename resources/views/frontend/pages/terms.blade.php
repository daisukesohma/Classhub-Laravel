                                create an Account on behalf of your business. By granting other Customers permissions

                                on your behalf, (b) you are financially responsible for the Customer’s actions taken in

                                contracts on behalf of the owner of the Account, and (c) you are fully responsible and
                                liable for any action of any Customer to whom you have provided any permissions and any

                                (&quot;<strong>Classes</strong>&quot;) for groups or individual Users. All Providers
                                must register initially for a User Account and subsequently for a Provider Account.
                                Customers who have registered for a User Account can identify and avail of the Classes.
                                The Site will include the ability for Customers to ‘chat’ to one another or to Providers
                                for the purposes of discussing products/services and generally exchange information.

                                all times, however, Customers are responsible for evaluating and determining the

                                        Classhub via the Site within 72 hours of receipt of the escalation notice.
                                        Classhub shall then make a determination in respect of the dispute within 7 days
                                        of receipt of such an escalation notice. If Classhub determines that a full or
                                        partial refund (applicable to groups and terms of Classes only) is due to the
                                        User, the refunded amount shall be returned to the User’s debit/credit card no
                                        later than 30 days from the making of the Refund Request. If Classhub determines
                                        that no refund is due to the User, the Class Fee shall then be released to
                                        Classhub, the Provider and Stripe in accordance with these Terms. Classhub’s
                                        determination of disputes shall be final and binding on Customers, and Classhub
                                        shall act reasonably in this regard. The Customer shall be sent a confirmation
                                        email in respect of any refund determination made by Classhub which is
                                        applicable to such Customer. The Customers expressly consent to this refund
                                        policy and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waive any rights he/she
                                        may have in respect of refunds of Bookings other than as set out herein.

                                        event you properly terminate these Terms, your right to use the Site and Site
                                        Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Classhub is
                                        not a party to any Sale Contract between Customers. Consequently, each Customer
                                        understands and acknowledges that termination of these Terms (or attempt to
                                        terminate these Terms) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Sale Contract
                                        entered into between Customers.

                                        Without limiting Classhub’s other rights or remedies, we may, but are not
                                        obligated to, temporarily or indefinitely revoke access to the Site or Site
                                        Services, deny your registration, or permanently revoke your access to the Site
                                        and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to you if: (i) you breach any
                                        terms and conditions of these Terms; (ii) we suspect or become aware that you
                                        have provided false or misleading information to us; or (iii) we believe, in our
                                        sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our
                                        Customers, or Classhub or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of
                                        the Site or the Customer community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity.
                                        If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site
                                        under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account
                                        without Classhub’s prior written consent. We may inform any law enforcement or
                                        regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where we believe
                                        disclosure is necessary under applicable law or regulations

                                        You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site
                                        depend on transparency of Customer’s Account status to all Customers, including
                                        both yourself and other Customers. You therefore agree as follows: IF CLASSHUB
                                        DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, CLASSHUB HAS THE RIGHT
                                        WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT
                                        HAVE ENTERED INTO SALE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT
                                        STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE CUSTOMERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR
                                        ACCOUNT CLOSURE. YOU AGREE THAT CLASSHUB WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR
                                        RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY CUSTOMER REGARDING CLOSED
                                        ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.

                                        Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason,
                                        you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you
                                        keep on the Site and that any closure of your Account may involve deletion of
                                        any content stored in your Account for which Classhub will have no liability
                                        whatsoever. Classhub, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by
                                        law, may retain some or all of your Account information.

                                        After these Terms terminate, the parts of these Terms that expressly or by their
                                        nature contemplate performance after these Terms terminate or expire will
                                        survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the dispute
                                        resolution provisions, protecting intellectual property, indemnification,
                                        payment of fees, limitations of liability, disclaimers and waivers, each, by
                                        their nature, contemplate performance or observance after these Terms terminate.
                                        Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms, the termination or expiry of
                                        these Terms for any reason will not release you or Classhub from any obligations
                                        incurred prior to termination of these Terms or that thereafter may accrue in
                                        respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

                                within such 30 Business Day period then, no more than once in any twelve (12) month
